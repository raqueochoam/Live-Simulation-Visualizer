### Team members:

## To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Run the `Simulation.py` file.
2. Install Flask in the terminal to ensure it works correctly:
   - `pip install flask`
3. Once installed, run `app.py` in the terminal:
   - `python app.py`
4. Open the HTTP address provided when executing the previous command in your browser. (usually is http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Notes:
There is a small bug with the “Run simulation” button, sometimes it doesn't overwrite the json file, we didn't manage to fix it and it seems that for a moment the graphics are deleted, but just by clicking the button again it works again.
